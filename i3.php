<td><h3>Alluring wildlife at K Gudi Wilderness Camp, BRT Hills - 1 day</h3>India is a land of rich biodiversity, owing to the different types of biomes and ecological zones. Among the most famous biodiversity regions in the country are the Western Ghats, which are recognised as one of the several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. A wide range of forests comprising shrubs, shola patches, deciduous trees and montane grasslands are found here. The Biligiri Rangana (BR Hills) sub-range within the Western Ghats is perhaps most richly endowed with wildlife as it acts as a junction between the Western and Eastern Ghats. Here you may see animals and plants, which are characteristic of both the mountain ranges. The array of hotels, resorts and camping establishments here offer lodgings to tourists. A venture of Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation, K Gudi Wilderness Camp on BR Hills offers you a holiday amidst serene environs, lush greenery and an ever-pleasant weather.<br><br>Rs. 5,057</td>

<td><h3>Scuba Diving in Goa - 8 hrs</h3>Scuba diving in Goa is an excellent adventure that you must undertake if you are seeking thrill and action.
