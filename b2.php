<p>Trekking in Bhutan reveals a spectacular, unspoilt country steeped in ancient traditions and with a history that is as tall as the Himalayas. Bhutan walking tours is the best way to experience its well-conserved pristine natural environment that passes through the villages of nomadic yak herders and showcases their closet rustic lifestyle. While some treks are short and suitable for beginners, others can be long and challenging. Hiking and trekking in Bhutan is truly an amazing experience that comprises walking through the tender and lush vegetations of the river valleys to the icy slopes of the eastern end of the Himalayas. The mountainous and magical Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is a hiker's paradise, which offers an opportunity to witness stunning views of unclimbed snow-capped mountains, ancient forest-grazed slopes dotted with historic fortress monasteries, temples and religious monuments.
